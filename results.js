                "title": "OSPW (Oily, Sensitive, Pigmented, Wrinkled)",
                "cause": "Cause: Androgen activation causes excessive sebum, collapsing the skin barrier and simultaneously overheating inflammation and melanin production.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: Dark scars and spots are left after acne breakouts, and chronic inflammation leads to a rapid decline in elasticity.",
                "solution": "Solution: Cleanse pores with low-irritation salicylic acid and manage pigmentation and wrinkles simultaneously with a low-concentration retinol containing soothing ingredients."

            "OSPT": {
                "title": "OSPT (Oily, Sensitive, Pigmented, Tight)",
                "cause": "Cause: A combination of genetic sebum excess and hypersensitivity to external stimuli constantly stimulates pigment-producing cells.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: The skin is shiny and simultaneously flushes red, and even minor troubles turn into long-lasting brown spots.",
                "solution": "Solution: Use an oil-free brightening essence and concurrently use niacinamide to control sebum and prevent pigmentation."
            },
            "OSNW": {
                "title": "OSNW (Oily, Sensitive, Non-Pigmented, Wrinkled)",
                "cause": "Cause: Despite high sebum secretion, the skin's protective barrier is weak, allowing the harmful environment to easily destroy dermal collagen.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: The skin is oily on the outside but feels tight and sensitive on the inside, with persistent inflammatory redness and deepening fine lines.",
                "solution": "Solution: Use a soothing toner that excludes irritating ingredients like alcohol and defend against skin aging with a light gel rich in antioxidants."
            },
            "OSRT": {
                "title": "OSRT (Oily, Sensitive, Resistant, Tight)",
                "cause": "Cause: The main causes are active sebaceous gland activity and an overactive immune system, but fortunately, genetic elasticity is excellent.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: The entire face is oily with frequent pustular acne, and it always feels red and hot as if having consumed alcohol.",
                "solution": "Solution: Soothe inflammation with tea tree or panthenol, and lower skin temperature through cooling care to suppress sebum secretion and redness."

            "ORPW": {
                "title": "ORPW (Oily, Resistant, Pigmented, Wrinkled)",
                "cause": "Cause: Sebum secretion is vigorous and the skin barrier is very robust, making it resistant to external stimuli, but internal pigmentary aging is in progress.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: Pores are large and the skin texture is rough; upon sun exposure, the skin tends to tan immediately rather than turning red, leading to deep wrinkles.",
                "solution": "Solution: Actively use high-concentration vitamin C and high-content retinol to remove dead skin cells and induce collagen regeneration in the dermis."
            },
            "ORPT": {
                "title": "ORPT (Oily, Resistant, Pigmented, Tight)",
                "cause": "Cause: The innate barrier is strong and resistant to most cosmetics, but excessive oil meets UV rays to cause pigmentation.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: The skin appears thick and firm, but the overall complexion is dull, with dark spots widely distributed around the cheeks and nose.",
                "solution": "Solution: Prevent pore blockage with regular chemical exfoliation (BHA) and improve complexion with water-based whitening products."
            },
            "ORNW": {
                "title": "ORNW (Oily, Resistant, Non-Pigmented, Wrinkled)",
                "cause": "Cause: While the sebaceous glands are developed, the anti-aging mechanism is insufficient, leading to a rapid decline in elasticity over time, although the skin is not sensitive.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: Despite the skin being shiny due to oiliness, nasolabial folds and forehead wrinkles are beginning to appear distinctly.",
                "solution": "Solution: Prescribe high concentrations of peptides and retinol to tighten loose skin tissue and forcibly balance the oil-water levels."
            },
            "ORNT": {
                "title": "ORNT (Oily, Resistant, Non-Pigmented, Tight)",
                "cause": "Cause: An adequate oil film perfectly blocks moisture evaporation and acts as a natural shield protecting the skin from external stimuli.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: Besides occasional shininess, the skin texture is smooth with almost no worries about blemishes or wrinkles—the most gifted healthy skin.",
                "solution": "Solution: Rather than using excessive functional cosmetics, maintain cleanliness with a mild acidic cleanser and maintain the current state with light moisturization."
            },
            "DSPW": {
                "title": "DSPW (Dry, Sensitive, Pigmented, Wrinkled)",
                "cause": "Cause: A complete lack of natural lipids has breached the barrier, leaving the skin dehydrated and the inflammatory and pigment cells exposed and defenseless.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: The skin is extremely dry and stinging, with a dense layer of dark spots, and micro-cracks and wrinkles are abundant on the surface, like a drought-stricken field.",
                "solution": "Solution: Go all-in on 'regeneration' rather than functionality, rebuild the barrier with ceramides and cholesterol, and then attempt ultra-low-irritation whitening."
            },
            "DSPT": {
                "title": "DSPT (Dry, Sensitive, Pigmented, Tight)",
                "cause": "Cause: The inability to retain moisture makes the barrier sensitive, allowing overactive melanocytes to easily create pigmentation.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: The skin always feels tight and red, and dark spots appear quickly upon sun exposure, but deep wrinkles are not yet a major concern.",
                "solution": "Solution: Frequently reapply a rich barrier moisturizer and brighten the complexion without irritation using vitamin derivative ingredients."
            },
            "DSNW": {
                "title": "DSNW (Dry, Sensitive, Non-Pigmented, Wrinkled)",
                "cause": "Cause: The sebaceous glands are very atrophied, producing almost no oil, which leads to a loss of control over the contraction and expansion of the dermal layer.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: The paper-thin skin becomes white and flaky and itches, and fine lines appear in layers around the eyes and mouth even without expression.",
                "solution": "Solution: Physically prevent moisture evaporation with a heavy balm-type moisturizer rather than a water-type one, and use antioxidant oils concurrently."
            },
            "DSRT": {
                "title": "DSRT (Dry, Sensitive, Resistant, Tight)",
                "cause": "Cause: The thin lipid protective layer causes an immediate reaction to the external environment, but the dermis is genetically firm.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: Feels extremely tight after washing and often experiences stinging when choosing cosmetics, but the skin tone is clear and the texture is smooth.",
                "solution": "Solution: Thoroughly exclude allergy-inducing ingredients and focus on lowering sensitivity by layering hyaluronic acid and panthenol to build up moisture."
            },
            "DRPW": {
                "title": "DRPW (Dry, Resistant, Pigmented, Wrinkled)",
                "cause": "Cause: Although the barrier is strong and less prone to irritation, the innate moisture content is low, making it very vulnerable to photoaging from UV rays.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: The skin is hard and rough, the complexion appears dark due to dryness, and dark spots are settled in sun-exposed areas.",
                "solution": "Solution: Increase absorption by dissolving rough dead skin cells with AHA ingredients, then layer a high-moisture nourishing cream and a whitening cream."
            },
            "DRPT": {
                "title": "DRPT (Dry, Resistant, Pigmented, Tight)",
                "cause": "Cause: Lacks moisture but has a good defense mechanism, so inflammation is low. However, as dryness persists, pigmentation becomes fixed.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: Feels rough to the touch and lacks overall radiance, with noticeable blemishes but maintained elasticity.",
                "solution": "Solution: Provide sufficient hydration and use botanical oils to create a lipid film, and meticulously apply sunscreen during the day."
            },
            "DRNW": {
                "title": "DRNW (Dry, Resistant, Non-Pigmented, Wrinkled)",
                "cause": "Cause: The skin cell regeneration rate is significantly slowed due to low oil and moisture levels, causing the collagen layer to become sparse.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: Dead skin cells rise in white flakes, making the skin always look rough, and a loss of elasticity causes the facial contours to sag and deep wrinkles to set in.",
                "solution": "Solution: Actively use anti-aging creams containing retinol and high-concentration fatty acids and promote blood circulation with oil massages."
            },
            "DRNT": {
                "title": "DRNT (Dry, Resistant, Non-Pigmented, Tight)",
                "cause": "Cause: Besides slight signs of dehydration, the skin cells' defensive and regenerative abilities are maintained in a very harmonious mechanism.",
                "symptoms": "Symptoms: The skin feels tight only briefly after cleansing and is clear and healthy, with a clean and smooth texture free of blemishes or wrinkles.",
                "solution": "Solution: Adhere to the basic steps of a moisture essence and moisturizing cream, and simply adjust the intensity of moisturization according to the season to be perfect."
