## Design and Features

### Implemented

*   Initial project setup.
*   Code pushed to GitHub repository.

### Current Plan: Home Shopping UI

*   **Layout:** A responsive grid layout for product cards.
*   **Header:** A simple header with a logo and navigation.
*   **Product Card Web Component (`<product-card>`):**
    *   Encapsulated styling with Shadow DOM.
    *   Product Image with hover effects.
    *   Product Title.
    *   Discounted Price and Original Price.
    *   Star Rating.
    *   "Add to Cart" button with interactive effects.
    *   Countdown timer for special offers.
*   **Styling:**
    *   **Color Palette:** Vibrant and energetic, with gradients and modern color spaces (`oklch`).
    *   **Typography:** Expressive and hierarchical fonts to guide the user's attention.
    *   **Effects:** Multi-layered drop shadows for a "lifted" card effect, subtle background textures, and glowing interactive elements.
*   **Interactivity:**
    *   Hover effects on product cards.
    *   Click effects on buttons.

## Plan for Current Request

1.  **Analyze Existing Files:** Read `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`.
2.  **Update `index.html`:** Set up the basic structure with a header, a main content area, and a template for the product cards.
3.  **Update `style.css`:** Implement the modern CSS for layout, product card styling, and visual effects.
4.  **Update `main.js`:** Create the `ProductCard` Web Component to render products and handle interactivity.
5.  **Add Placeholder Images:** Find and use placeholder images for the products.
